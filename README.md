### Bifurcations Project  
# Computational Physics Period 10  
# Members: Amy, Chi, Sophia  

## Assignment  
Research how the Feigenbaum ratio is calculated, and research a few other systems in which it can be used to find the width of a bifurcation interval. Then, code the logistic map using Python's VPython module, and be able to zoom into appropriate levels to get a good resolution view of the r values when the bifurcations occur. Finally, using our coded map, calculate the Feigenbaum ratio.
